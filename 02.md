### Course Selection: Required Courses, Elective Courses, and Possible Minors

Selecting the right courses is a crucial part of your Personal Study Plan (PSP). Here’s a detailed guide on how to approach course selection, including required courses, elective courses, and possible minors.

#### 1. Required Courses

**Definition**: These are mandatory courses that you must complete to fulfill the requirements of your degree program. They provide the foundational knowledge and skills essential to your field of study.

**Steps to Select Required Courses**:
- **Review Program Requirements**: Check your program’s curriculum on the university website or the Sisu system to identify all required courses.
- **Plan According to Prerequisites**: Note any prerequisites for these courses and plan your schedule accordingly.
- **Sequence Your Courses**: Determine the best sequence for taking these courses over your semesters, considering your workload and course availability.

#### 2. Elective Courses

**Definition**: Elective courses offer flexibility and allow you to explore areas of interest beyond the required curriculum. They can enhance your knowledge and skills in specific areas or complement your major.

**Steps to Select Elective Courses**:
- **Identify Interests and Career Goals**: Choose electives that align with your interests and career aspirations.
- **Check Availability**: Ensure the electives you’re interested in are available during the semesters you plan to take them.
- **Balance Your Workload**: Consider the difficulty level of electives in relation to your required courses to maintain a balanced workload.
- **Explore Different Fields**: Use electives to explore courses outside your main field of study that might be beneficial for your overall education and career.

#### 3. Possible Minors

**Definition**: A minor is a secondary field of study that you can pursue alongside your major. It typically requires a smaller number of courses than a major but still provides substantial knowledge in the chosen area.

**Steps to Select a Minor**:
- **Review Minor Options**: Check the list of available minors on the university’s website or the Sisu system.
- **Align with Career Goals**: Choose a minor that complements your major and aligns with your career goals.
- **Understand Requirements**: Each minor will have its own set of required and elective courses. Ensure you understand these requirements.
- **Plan Your Schedule**: Incorporate the minor courses into your overall study plan, ensuring you can meet all the requirements without overloading any semester.
