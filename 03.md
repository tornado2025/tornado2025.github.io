### Creating a Study Schedule: Timing Your Courses

Developing an effective study schedule is crucial for managing your coursework, meeting prerequisites, and balancing your academic workload with personal commitments. Here’s how to plan when to take each course, considering prerequisites and your personal timetable.

#### 1. Understanding Prerequisites

**Definition**: Prerequisites are courses or requirements that must be completed before enrolling in a subsequent course.

**Steps to Manage Prerequisites**:
- **List Prerequisites**: Identify the prerequisites for each course in your program.
- **Sequence Courses**: Plan the sequence of your courses to ensure all prerequisites are completed in time.
- **Check for Concurrent Enrollment**: Some courses may allow concurrent enrollment in prerequisites, but confirm this with the course coordinator.

#### 2. Balancing Your Workload

**Definition**: Balancing your workload involves distributing your courses in a way that avoids overloading any single semester.

**Steps to Balance Workload**:
- **Estimate Course Load**: Understand the workload and difficulty level of each course (e.g., credits, hours per week).
- **Distribute Evenly**: Spread challenging and high-credit courses across different semesters.
- **Include Electives**: Mix electives with required courses to maintain a diverse and manageable schedule.
- **Consider Part-Time Work or Extracurriculars**: If you have a job or participate in extracurricular activities, factor these into your schedule to avoid overcommitting.

#### 3. Creating a Semester-by-Semester Plan

**Steps to Plan Each Semester**:
1. **Start with Core Courses**: Begin by scheduling required core courses, ensuring all prerequisites are met.
2. **Add Electives and Minors**: Fill in electives and courses for any minors, balancing your interests and workload.
3. **Check Course Availability**: Verify that your chosen courses are offered in the planned semester. Adjust as necessary.
4. **Plan for Flexibility**: Leave some flexibility for unforeseen changes, such as course cancellations or personal circumstances.

#### 4. Using Tools and Resources

**Sisu System**:
- **Log in to Sisu**: Use Tampere University’s Sisu system to access your study plan, course catalog, and registration.
- **Plan Your Schedule**: Input your planned courses into Sisu to visualize your timetable.
- **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure there are no scheduling conflicts between courses.

**Advisors and Mentors**:
- **Consult Advisors**: Regularly meet with your academic advisor to review and adjust your plan.
- **Seek Mentorship**: Experienced students or faculty can provide valuable insights into course planning and workload management.

**Personal Timetable**:
- **Create a Weekly Schedule**: Develop a weekly timetable that includes class times, study periods, work, and personal commitments.
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Be realistic about the time needed for studying, assignments, and rest.

#### 5. Adjusting Your Plan

**Regular Review**:
- **Monitor Progress**: Regularly check your progress in Sisu to ensure you are meeting your goals.
- **Update Your Plan**: Adjust your plan as needed based on course availability, academic performance, and personal circumstances.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with any changes in course offerings or program requirements.
